<h1>Preferences</h1>
<p>The settings for Vespucci are split over two screens: standard and advanced preferences. The more commonly used settings should in general be in the first screen.</p>
<h2>Data style</h2>
<p>The style that is used to render OpenStreetmap data. Additional styles can be added by including corresponding files in the Vespucci directory.</p>
<h2>Custom layers</h2>
<p>Configure a custom imagery layer not included in the standard configuration.</p>
<h2>Keep screen on</h2>
<p>Disable the Android automatic screen lock.</p>
<h2>Large node drag area</h2>
<p>Display a large ring around selected nodes making draging and positioning nodes easier.</p>
<h2>Presets</h2>
<p>Start preset management screen. Vespucci supports JOSM style presets that can be downloaded and added from this screen.</p>
<h2>Validator settings</h2>
<h3>Validator settings</h3>
<p>Configure the standard validator.</p>
<p>There are currently two configurable checks: a check for missing keys and an aged based one for re-surveying.</p>
<p>The missing tag check works on the combination of the keys that should be checked and the preset for element.</p>
<p>Example: the default configuration checks that a &quot;name&quot; tag is present on a object if the matching preset contains a &quot;name&quot; field in the non-optional tags, optionally the check can be extended to require &quot;optional&quot; tags.</p>
<h3>Connected node tolerance</h3>
<p>Configure how far away from a highway a highway end node must be to not be highlighted as an error.</p>
<h2>Opening hours templates</h2>
<p>The dialog displayed allows to edit the meta-data for individual templates or delete them, save the current templates and load templates from files.</p>
<h2>Advanced preferences</h2>
<p>Starts the advanced preferences editor.</p>
