A long press will display a list of the operations since the last save, if you have undone anything a corresponding &quot;redo&quot; action will be displayed. If the undo results in the current selected object being removed you will be returned to the main screen. <em>Some operations consist of multiple simpler actions that will be listed as individual items.</em></p>
